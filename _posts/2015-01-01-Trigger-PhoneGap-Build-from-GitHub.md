You can remotely trigger a build by using the API: https://build.phonegap.com/docs/api

First you need to get your auth token:
`$ curl -u me@gbraad.nl-X POST -d "" https://build.phonegap.com/token
`

Test it and retrieve your appid using the following command:
`$ curl https://build.phonegap.com/api/v1/me?auth_token=[token]
`

After this go to your Github repo, open the admin and go to 'Service hooks'. Add a new WebHook URL (first option) and add yours 
`https://build.phonegap.com/apps/[appid]/build/?auth_token=[token]
`

Save this and trigger it with 'Test hook'. When you would open: ```https://build.phonegap.com/apps/[appid]/builds``` you will probably see a new build.
